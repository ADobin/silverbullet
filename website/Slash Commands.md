Slash commands are quick ways to perform repetitive tasks. 99% of the time this will mean using a [[Library/Std/Slash Templatese]], but you can also create them more manually using [[Space Lua#Slash commands]].

# Invoking a slash command
You can trigger a slash command by typing a `/` in your text (after some white space) followed by its name (this will auto complete).

Technically, no slash commands ship with SilverBullet directly. However, you can easily add useful ones via [[Libraries]].

# Triggering commands with slash commands
To trigger any existing [[Commands]] via a slash command, you can configure them as shortcuts, see: [[Shortcuts]].
