# Silver Bullet
## Markdown as a platform
Silver Bullet (SB) is a highly extensible, open source **personal knowledge playground**. At its core itâ€™s a Markdown-based writing/note taking application that stores _pages_ (notes) as plain markdown files in a folder referred to as a _space_. Pages can be cross-linked using the `[[link to other page]]` syntax. This makes it a simple tool for [Personal Knowledge Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management). However, once you leverage its various extensions (called _plugs_) it can feel more like a _knowledge playground_, allowing you to annotate, combine and query your accumulated knowledge in creative ways, specific to you.

What does Silver Bullet look like? Well, have a look around. **Youâ€™re looking at it at this very moment!** Say what!? 

Feel free to make some edits, to get a feel for it. Donâ€™t worry, you wonâ€™t break anything, nothing is saved (just reload the page to see).

Things to try:

* Click on the page name at the top, or hit `Cmd-k` (Mac) or `Ctrl-k` (Linux and Windows) to open the _page switcher_. Type the a name of a non-existing page to create it (although it wonâ€™t save in this environment).
* Click on the run button (top right) or hit `Cmd-/` (Mac) or `Ctrl-/` (Linux and Windows) to open the _command palette_ (note not all command will work in this quasi read-only mode).
* Select some text and hit `Alt-m` to highlight it, or `Cmd-b` (Mac) or `Ctrl-b` to make it bold.
* Click a link below to navigate there
* Start typing `[[` somewhere to insert a page link (with completion)
* [ ] Tap this box ðŸ‘ˆ to mark this task as done
* Start typing `:pa` to trigger the emoji picker ðŸŽ‰
* Type `/` somewhere in the text to use a _slash command_.
* Open this site on your phone or tablet andâ€¦ it just works!

## Installing and running Silver Bullet
Like what youâ€™re seeing? Install it yourself locally or on your server! Itâ€™s free.

To run a release version, you need to have a recent version of [node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/) (16+) as well as some basic build infrastructure (make, cpp). Silver Bullet has only been tested on MacOS and Linux thus far.

To install and run, create a folder for your pages (can be empty or an existing folder with `.md` files) and run:

    npx @silverbullet/server <path-to-folder>

Optionally you can use the `--port` argument to specify a HTTP port (defaults to `3000`) and you can pass a `--password` flag to require a password to access. Note this is a rather weak security mechanism, so itâ€™s recommended to add additional layers of security on top of this if you run this on a public server somewhere (at least add TLS). Personally I run it on a tiny Linux VM on my server at home, and use a VPN (Tailscale) to access it from outside my home.
