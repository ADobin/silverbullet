The primary thing you’ll be doing in SilverBullet (hopefully) is creating and editing pages. Pages are written in [[Markdown]], can contain [[Metadata]] and are kept on the server as text files.

There’s not much more to say about pages.

Ah one thing, [[Templates]] are “special” types of page that can be used for various purposes (e.g. as a _template_ for a new page, or to render [[Live Queries]] and [[Live Templates]]).
