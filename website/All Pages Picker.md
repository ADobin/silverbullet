The all pages picker can be used to open any page, including [[Meta Pages]] and pages hidden with [[Page Decorations]]. Otherwise itâ€™s equivalent to the [[Page Picker]].

To open, run the command ${widgets.commandButton("Navigate: All Pages Picker")} using this button or [[Command Palette]]. Alternatively cycle from any other Picker by typing `^`.
