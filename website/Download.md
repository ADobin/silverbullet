You have three options to install and use SilverBullet. Pick your poison, as they say. Have a look at all three to decide what’s best for you:

1. [[Server]] — install SilverBullet as a web server on your local machine or network, and access it via any web browser. This is the best choice for nerds 🤓.
2. [[Desktop]] — install SilverBullet as a desktop application, editing a local folder of files. This is the best option for casual users.
3. [[Mobile]] — install SilverBullet as a “native” mobile application (native: as in — distributed via the app store, and with an icon on your home screen). This is the best option for people with phones. More specifically, people with phones that don’t want to access the [[Server]] via their mobile browser, or have anxiety around Internet connectivity.
