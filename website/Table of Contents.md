The Table of Contents widget, when enabled, shows a table of contents at the start of the page for any page with 3 headers or more. It is updated whenever hovering the mouse cursor over it. Clicking any of the headers will navigate there within the page.

You can enable/disable this feature via {[Table of Contents: Toggle]}.
