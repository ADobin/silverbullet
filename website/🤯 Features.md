## Core features
- **Free and open source**. Silver Bullet is [MIT licensed](https://github.com/silverbulletmd/silverbullet/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
- **The truth is in the markdown.** Markdown is simply text files, stored on disk. Nothing fancy. No proprietary formats or lock in. While SB uses an (SQLite) database for indexing and caching some data, all of that can be rebuilt from its markdown source at any time. If SB would ever go away, you can still read your pages with any text editor.
- [**Local first**](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/): your content is under your own control.
- **Single, distraction-free mode.** SB doesn’t have a separate view and edit mode. It doesn’t have a “focus mode.” You’re always in focused edit mode, why wouldn’t you?
* **Run anywhere**: run it on your local machine, or install it on a server. You access it via your web browser (desktop or mobile), or install it as a PWA (giving it its own window frame and dock/launcher/dock icon).
- **Keyboard oriented**. You can use SB fully using the keyboard, typin’ the keys.
- **Extend it your way**. SB is highly extensible with [[🔌 Plugs]], and you can customize it to your liking and your workflows.

## Advanced 
* Make part of your page _dynamic_ using [[🔌 Directive]]s such as [[🔌 Directive/Query]]
