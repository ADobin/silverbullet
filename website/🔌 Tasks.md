The Tasks plug implements a lot of the task support in Silver Bullet.

Tasks in Silver Bullet are written using semi-standard task syntax:

* [ ] This is a task

Tasks can also be annotated with [[ðŸ”Œ Core/Tags]]:

* [ ] This is a tagged task #my-tag

You can _toggle_ a task state either by putting in an `x` or `X` inside the box, or by simply clicking/tapping on the box, alternatively you can use the {[Task: Toggle]} command to toggle the task youâ€™re currently in.

Tasks can specify deadlines:

* [ ] This is due ðŸ“… 2022-11-26

When the cursor is positioned inside of a due date, the {[Task: Postpone]} command can be used to postpone the task for a certain period of time.

This metadata is extracted and available via the `task` query source to [[ðŸ”Œ Directive/Query]]:

<!-- #query task where page = "{{page}}"" -->
|name                 |done |page    |pos|tags  |deadline  |
|---------------------|-----|--------|---|------|----------|

<!-- /query -->
