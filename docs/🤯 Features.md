* **Free and open source** (MIT licensed)
* **Distraction free** UI with [What You See is What You Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM) Markdown editing.
* **Future proof**: stores all notes in a regular folder with markdown files, no proprietary file formats. While SB uses a SQLite database for indexes, this database can be wiped and rebuilt based on your pages at any time. Your Markdown files are the single source of truth.
* **Run anywhere**: run it on your local machine, or install it on a server. You access it via your web browser (desktop or mobile), or install it as a PWA (giving it its own window frame and dock/launcher/dock icon).
* **Keyboard oriented:** you can fully operate SB via the keyboard (on laptop/desktop machines as well as iPads with a keyboard):
  * Switch between pages using `Cmd-k` (Mac) or `Ctrl-k` (Linux/Windows)
  * Open the command palette using `Cmd-/` (Mac) or `Ctrl-/` (Linux/Windows)
  * Use slash commands by entering a `/` in your noteâ€™s text
  * Various plugs add additional keyboard shortcuts and auto completions like when entering `[[page links]]` and typing emoji via the `:lemon:` syntax.
* **Extensible** through plugs (see below)
